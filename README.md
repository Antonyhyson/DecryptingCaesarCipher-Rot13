Caesar encryption rot13

>ROT13 ("rotate 13 positions") is a simple Caesar cipher used to hide a text by replacing each letter with the letter that is thirteen positions ahead >in the alphabet. A becomes N, B becomes O, and so on to M, which becomes Z. Then the sequence reverses: N becomes A, >O becomes B, and so on to Z, which becomes in M. This algorithm is used in Internet forums as a means to hide from casual eyes the >end of a joke, the solution to a riddle, the gutting of a movie or a story, or some offensive text. ROT13 has been described as the ">Usenet equivalent of a magazine that prints the answer to a quiz upside down."
